# PokerJS
A Basic Poker Library For Javascript

This library is solely for creating hands of 5 cards randomly and checking the poker hand ranking of said cards.

~~The ability to make sure that a previous cards is not called again in the hand has not been added, but is planned in the future.~~
That was easier than I thought. (Warning, contains voodoo code.)

Can now discard cards as well.
